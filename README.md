# ELEX / Electronic Lexikon-Roman

## About

This project is dedicated to a new multimedia edition of a novel by Austrian writer Andreas Okopenko called "Lexikon einer sentimentalen Reise zum Exporteurtreffen in Druden â€“ Roman" (Lexikon-Roman).
Find out more about ELEX [here](https://www.essl.at/bibliogr/elex.html).

## Getting started

This repository is currently all about editing of HTML/CSS version of the novel. We use Pug tamplates to generate HTML, therefore you need to [install it](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) to work on this part of the project.
Then you need to run

```
pug -w pug -o pages -P

```

This will make it watch for changes in the Pug files that are located in `./pug` directory and automatically render them at the `./pages` directory with prettified HTML markup.

## Contribution
