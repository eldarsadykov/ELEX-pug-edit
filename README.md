## Getting Started

This repository is focused on editing the HTML/CSS version of the novel. We use Pug templates to generate HTML. Therefore, you need to [install it](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) to work on this part of the project. 
Then you need to run

```
pug --watch pug --out pages --pretty
```

from the repository's directory. This command will watch for changes in the Pug files located in the `./pug` directory and automatically render them to the `./pages` directory with prettified HTML markup.
